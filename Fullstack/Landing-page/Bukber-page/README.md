## ~Bad~ Simple Landing Page!
~As always, before starting please forgive my bad English.~

> _English is just a languange, not a parameter for measuring your intelligence. So if you don't know English, it's okay. That doesn't undermine your intellectual faculties._
>
> â€” _Just Quotes._

~This landing page was inspired from a website I found. I honestly don't know what color to match or maybe look good, so let it be.~

~You can make complete changes to `index.html`, `style.css` or even `script.js`, etc.~
